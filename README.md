# I.AI Fellow's Platform Engineering test

### Intro

- This is test designed to really test your knowledge on both AWS services and architecture, as well as Terrafrom best practices. The overall purpose is ensuring you know how to both code and understand modern systems in the cloud.

- You will need to share your screen via Google Meet and run through the solution with the interviewers.

- You'll be provided an access key, secret access key and the name of an IAM role you can assume into an I.AI AWS account by the interviewer.

- You should spend roughly 2 hours or less on the solution. This is not expected to be the fully working solution but a good attempt should be made with the ability to present the solutions afterwards with any longterm implementations you'd like to make.

### 1. The Business Requirements
